# MAP VPS Setup

Authors: @neptuneresearch @serhack

## Usage
See ```/map_vps_setup_files``` for configuration files.  
  
See ```/map_vps_setup_scripts``` for bash scripts for each section.  
The first script ```0_map_vps_setup.sh``` will set all of the scripts as executable and proceed to run them all, pausing for user keypress after each section completes.


# OS Setup

## Software Update
Run the following command to update the OS packages.

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y 

This may cause the ```grub``` installer to appear. If it does:

1. Optional: Review differences
2. Accept differences
3. Choose the device the OS is installed on, default is ```/dev/sda```
4. Choose not to install ```grub```


## Unattended-upgrades

This may already be installed.  
See [Automatic Updates](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades) for more information.

    sudo apt install unattended-upgrades


## UFW Firewall
1. Install.

    ```sudo apt-get install ufw```

2. Configure by running each of the following rule commands.

| Rule Command | Purpose |
| - | - |
| ```sudo ufw default allow outgoing``` | Allow all outgoing traffic |
| ```sudo ufw default deny incoming``` | Deny all incoming traffic by default |
| ```sudo ufw allow from any to any port 4422 proto tcp``` | Allow incoming traffic to ```TCP port 4422``` for ```sshd``` |
| ```sudo ufw allow from any to any port 18080 proto tcp``` | Allow incoming traffic to ```TCP port 18080``` for ```monerod``` |

3. Enable the firewall and its logging.

    ```sudo ufw enable```  
    ```sudo ufw logging on```

## UTC Time Zone
All MAP nodes must be in the **UTC time zone** in order to standardize the timestamps in the archive output.

1. Run the timezone configuration tool.  

    ```sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata```
    
2. Enter the following configuration.

| Setting | Value |
| - | - |
| Geographic area | None of the above |
| Time zone | UTC |

3. Result example:

    ```Current default time zone: 'Etc/UTC'```  
    ```Local time is now:      Sun Oct  7 00:13:21 UTC 2018.```  
    ```Universal Time is now:  Sun Oct  7 00:13:21 UTC 2018.```  


## Hostname MAP-CITY-X
Set the hostname to ```MAP-CITY-X```, where ```CITY``` is the city where the server is physically located, and ```X``` is the index of the server in that city starting at 0. Example: ```MAP-TOKYO-0```

    sudo echo "MAP-CITY-0" > /etc/hostname
    sudo hostname -F /etc/hostname


## Hosts File Self Entry
If the server has a domain name, add a self entry for the server to the file ```/etc/hosts```.

Add line to end:

    0.0.0.0 server.org hostname

where:

| Key | Value |
| - | - |
| 0.0.0.0 | Public IP for server |
| server.org | Domain name for server |
| hostname | Hostname for server (```MAP-CITY-X```, same as in ```/etc/hostname```) |


## Message of the Day
Set the Message of the Day on the server with the following command.

    sudo echo "Welcome to $HOSTNAME part of the MAP (Monero Archival Project). Project coordinator : IsthmusCrypto. Infra Coordinator : SerHack. Any issues should be reported to the Project Coordinator" > /etc/motd



## MAP User Account
1. Create the user account ```map```.

    ```sudo adduser map```

2. Add ```map``` to ```sudo``` group so it can ```sudo```.

    ```sudo usermod -aG sudo map```

3. Create ```sshusers``` group (used by ```sshd_config AllowGroups```).

    ```sudo groupadd sshusers```

4. Add ```map``` to ```sshusers``` group.

    ```sudo adduser map sshusers```


## sshd Configuration

Recommend to first backup original configuration file ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` for future reference.

### Quick Configuration
1. Install the file ```map_vps_setup_files/sshd_config``` as ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config```.

2. Skip to step 4 of the Full Configuration.

### Full Configuration
Configure sshd via its configuration file ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` as follows.

#### 1. Add Custom Settings
Add the following settings.

| Setting | Description |
| - | - |
| ```Port 4422``` | Use nonstandard port so that naive attempts to connect on the default port are rejected quicker |
| ```AddressFamily inet``` | Use ipv4 only |
| ```PermitRootLogin no``` | No ```root``` account login over ssh |
| ```LoginGraceTime 60``` | Login attempts timeout after 60 seconds |
| ```MaxAuthTries 8``` | Login attempts limit to 8 |
| ```PubkeyAuthentication yes``` | Enable login via public key authentication |
| ```AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys``` | File which stores authorized public keys (*NOTE: this is one line, the Markdown may have wrapped it to 2 lines*) |
| ```PasswordAuthentication no``` | Disable login via password |
| ```Protocol 2``` | Disable SSH protocol V1 |
| ```AllowGroups sshusers``` | Only allow login from users of group ```sshusers``` |

#### 2. Check Default Settings
The following default settings can remain.

| Default Setting |
| - |
| ```ChallengeResponseAuthentication no``` |
| ```UsePAM yes``` |
| ```X11Forwarding yes``` |
| ```PrintMotd no``` |
| ```AcceptEnv LANG LC_*``` |
| ```Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server``` |

#### 3. Disable All Other Settings
All other settings in the file that do not appear in the table below should be disabled by commenting the line with ```#``` at the beginning, ex: ```#AddressFamily any```

#### 4. Add Authorized Keys
1. Create the folder ```/home/map/.ssh``` and ```chmod 700 /home/map/.ssh```.

2. Install the file ```/map_vps_setup_files/authorized_keys``` as ```/home/map/.ssh/authorized_keys``` and ```chmod 600 /home/map/.ssh/authorized_keys```.

3. Add other public SSH keys as desired.

4. Set owner on ```/home/map/.ssh``` and its contents: ```sudo chown -R map:map /home/map/.ssh```

#### 5. Apply Configuration
After configuring, restart ssh.

    sudo systemctl restart ssh

#### 6. Troubleshooting
If ssh fails to restart because of bad configuration, you can find the invalid configuration line(s) in the syslog at ```/var/log/syslog```.

#### 7. Expected ssh Responses
With the above configuration:

| ssh login command | ssh response |
| - | - |
| ```ssh map@map-city-0``` | ```Connection refused``` |
| ```ssh map@map-city-0 -p 4422 -i ~/.ssh/map``` (and client DOES NOT have key in ```authorized_keys```) | ```Permission denied (publickey)``` |
| ```ssh map@map-city-0 -p 4422 -i ~/.ssh/map``` (and client DOES have key in ```authorized_keys``` ) | Login is successful |

# collectd Setup

## Install collectd

    aptâˆ’get install collectd collectd-utils

## Quick Configuration
Install the file ```map_vps_setup_files/collectd.conf``` as ```/etc/collectd/collectd.conf```.

## Full Configuration
1. Edit the file ```/etc/collectd/collectd.conf``` and enable the plugin "Network". The other plugins (cpu, df etc..) have been already enabled . [A list of plugins that can be set up.](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins)

    TODO: add lists of plugins enabled.

2. Add the following block in Plugin configuration section

```
<Plugin processes>
	CollectFileDescriptor true
	CollectContextSwitch true
	Process "monerod-archive-v7"
</Plugin>

<Plugin ping>
    Host "$GRAFANAHOST"
    Interval 1.0
    Timeout 0.9
    TTL 255
    MaxMissed -1
